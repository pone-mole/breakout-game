# Welcome to Trang Do's breakout game

This game was programmed as part of the coursework at Northeastern University, specifically CS2510 Fundamentals to Computer Science 2.
The game uses javalib's funworld and worldimages to create the gamescape.

This game was a collaboration between Trang Do and McKenna Guam with the assistance of the CS2510 instructor team.
